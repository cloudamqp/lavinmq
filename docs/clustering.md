# Clustering

LavinMQ supports multi-node clustering with leader-based replication, using etcd for leader election and coordination.

## Architecture

- **Leader** — accepts all client connections and writes. Replicates data to followers.
- **Followers** — receive replicated data from the leader. Can be promoted to leader on failover.
- **etcd** — external coordination service for leader election, ISR tracking, and shared state.

Only the leader handles client traffic. Followers maintain a synchronized copy of the data.

## Enabling Clustering

```ini
[clustering]
enabled = true
bind = 0.0.0.0
port = 5679
advertised_uri = tcp://node1.example.com:5679
etcd_endpoints = etcd1:2379,etcd2:2379,etcd3:2379
etcd_prefix = lavinmq
```

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for all clustering options.

## Replication

### Bulk Sync

When a follower first connects (or has fallen too far behind), it performs a bulk sync:

1. The leader sends a file index with checksums of all data files
2. The follower requests files that are missing or have mismatching checksums
3. While syncing, the leader queues changes

### Incremental Replication

After bulk sync, the leader streams changes in real-time:

- **Appends** — bytes to append to data files (message segments, definitions)
- **Deletes** — files that have been removed
- **Rewrites** — files that have been completely rewritten (e.g., compacted definitions)

Data is compressed with LZ4 during replication.

### What Gets Replicated

- Definitions (exchanges, queues, bindings, users, permissions, policies, parameters)
- Message data (segments, acknowledgment files)
- All persistent vhost data

### ISR (In-Sync Replicas)

The ISR set tracks which followers are fully synchronized. A follower joins the ISR after completing bulk sync and staying current.

| Config Key | Section | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `max_unsynced_actions` | `[clustering]` | `8192` | Maximum unacknowledged actions a follower can lag before being removed from the ISR |

## Failover

If the leader fails, etcd coordinates leader election among ISR members. The first ISR member to successfully campaign becomes the new leader.

### Leader Election Hooks

Shell commands can be executed on leadership transitions:

```ini
[clustering]
on_leader_elected = /usr/local/bin/update-dns.sh
on_leader_lost = /usr/local/bin/drain-connections.sh
```

## Clustering Proxy

When a node is a follower, it automatically proxies client traffic to the current leader. Clients can connect to any node in the cluster on the normal protocol ports and reach the leader without needing to know which node is the leader.

The proxy is transparent and runs on every follower for:

- AMQP and AMQPS (TCP and Unix socket)
- MQTT and MQTTS (TCP and Unix socket)
- HTTP/management (TCP and Unix socket)

For AMQP TCP traffic, the proxy prepends a PROXY protocol v1 header so the leader sees the original client address. No configuration is needed; the proxy starts and stops automatically as leadership changes.

## Security

Followers authenticate to the leader using a shared secret stored in etcd. The secret is randomly generated on first cluster initialization and stored under `{etcd_prefix}/clustering_secret`.
