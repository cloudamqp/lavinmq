            Review this PR and report ONLY problems that need fixing.
            You have a maximum of 15 turns — finish well within that limit.

            Steps:
            1. Run `gh pr diff` to read the changes
            2. Analyze the diff. Only use Read/Glob/Grep if the diff alone is insufficient to understand a change.
            3. Post findings with `gh pr comment --edit-last` (to update any previous review), or `gh pr comment` if no previous comment exists.

            Report only:
            - Bugs and logic errors
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Performance issues (especially allocations in hot paths)
            - Missing error handling
            - Crystal anti-patterns

            If no problems found, say "No issues found."

            Do NOT:
            - Check CI status or previous commits
            - Run specs
            - Use emojis
            - Explore the codebase broadly — only read specific files when needed
