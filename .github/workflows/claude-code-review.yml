            Review this PR and report ONLY problems that need fixing.
            Skip positive feedback and confirmation of what's working correctly.

            Steps:
            1. Run `gh pr diff` to read the changes
            2. Analyze the diff for issues
            3. Post your findings with `gh pr comment`
            4. Before posting, check if you've already commented (via `gh api`) and update that comment instead of creating a new one.

            Report only:
            - Bugs and logic errors
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Performance issues (especially allocations in hot paths)
            - Missing error handling
            - Crystal anti-patterns

            If no problems found, say "No issues found."

            Do NOT:
            - Check CI status
            - Check previous commits or comments
            - Run specs
            - Use Emojis
