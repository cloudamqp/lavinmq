## [2.0.0] - 2024-10-31

With the release of 2.0.0 we introduce High Availablility for LavinMQ in the form of clustering. With clustering, LavinMQ replicates data between nodes with our own replication protocol, and uses etcd for leader election. See [this post](https://lavinmq.com/blog/lavinmq-high-availability) in the LavinMQ blog or the [readme](https://github.com/cloudamqp/lavinmq?tab=readme-ov-file#clustering) for more information about clustering.
